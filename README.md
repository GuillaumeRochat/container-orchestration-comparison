# Container Orchestration Comparison

### About

My employer wants to move our application to the cloud over the next few years. To do that, we need to see the state of the current ecosystem. This is the result of a few days/weeks of reading on the container orchestration subject and collecting data from different sources of information. It is in an attempt at getting an overview of the different container orchestrators available prior to attempting a proof of concept. **It is by no mean formed from personnal experience regarding those tools and should not be treated as such.**

We haven't found a centralized source of comparison between the different tools available and had to search for what needs to be taken into consideration and what each tool has to offer. The result is what we believe most outsiders of this ecosystem would observe over their first contact. Is this the true portrait of the ecosystem? Have we missed tools or features that should also be considered? Are some of the information wrong?

**Your contributions are welcomed. Your experience is valuable to create a better overview of the ecosystem.**
